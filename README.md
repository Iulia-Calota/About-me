 ###<center> From pharmacy assistant to QA tester, quality is the main goal.
So here I am, with almost 3 years of experience as a QA manual tester, worked on Roblox project, where I performed both static and dynamic testing, to ensure that quality standards are met and fit the end user.

With a background as a technical support, seller development on the Marketplace platform, and a pharmacy assistant, I know what it means to be emphatic, communicative, disciplined, and business-oriented.

I am keen on sharing ideas, experiences and setting new quality standards.
